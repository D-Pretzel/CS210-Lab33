    // integrity check. The function accepts a character array as input and returns
    // the exclusive or combination of each character in the array. As in starting
    // at 0, keep a running combination of each character in the array using the
    // bitwise exclusive or (xor) operator. Return the final checksum as a uint8_t type.

    // that it works. Note that for many reasons, including the commutative property of
    // the exclusive or operator, this is not a valid data integrity check.
